<div style="overflow:auto; height:200px;">

## May 31, 2024 - Review of Proposal Notes

- The user groups have been identified correctly and the functional requirements are on par with the project expectations.
- The design of the platform should be similar to Canvas, an LMS that students are already familiar with.
- System should accept links such as Google Doc, Google Drive, GitHub etc. as submission links.
- Instructor should be able to restrict submission files/links. For example, only accept .PDF or .ZIP or only Google Docs links (this can be managed by domain, e.g. docs.google.comâ€¦).
- No mobile compatibility is needed.

### Note for the administrators:

- They should be able to "approve" instructor accounts.
- What do you mean by log of online users? ~7:25 in the proposal video.

### Additional Features:

- Instructors should be able to extend deadlines for students.
- The system should be able to compile the peer reviews and assign a numeric grade to a student based on the average of numeric peer review received.
- The system should be able to provide notifications to students on when they're assigned items to review, reminder to submit review etc.
- Instructor should be able to set the peer reviews should be anonymous or not anonymous.
- Instructor should be able to manually assign students to specific assignments as needed (although this process should be automatic at first, with human intervention coming in as needed).
