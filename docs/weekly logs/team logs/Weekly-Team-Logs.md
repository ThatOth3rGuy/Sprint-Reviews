### Overview:
This week, significant progress was made in the development of the peer review system. A peer review form was created specifically for instructors. This form allows instructors to add a rubric and other advanced options to guide the review process. In addition, instructors now have the ability to manually select students for the peer review, providing greater control over the review process.

A base template for the student peer review form was also created. This template will serve as a starting point for students when they are conducting peer reviews.

Looking back at the last week, several key features were implemented:

 * Assignment Creation: Instructors now have the ability to create assignments with an option to restrict file types. This ensures that students submit their work in the desired format.
* Assignment Submission and View: Students can now submit their assignments and view them after submission. This provides students with confirmation that their work has been successfully submitted.
* Course Creation: Instructors have the ability to create new courses. This is a crucial feature that allows instructors to manage their teaching materials effectively.
* Student Registration in Course: Students can now register in courses. This feature makes it easy for students to enroll in the courses they are interested in.

Overall, these enhancements significantly improve the functionality and user experience of the system. The team continues to work diligently to implement additional features and improvements

### Overview:

The team has made significant progress and has begun constructing the systems according to the data flow diagram (DFD). For a more comprehensive understanding, we have further divided the system into distinct features. We have established a main feature branch that further splits into sub-features.

We have implemented the functionality for assignment creation by the instructor and submission by students (each submission is unique to the student’s ID). In addition, instructors can now create courses and add students to these courses using a .csv file.

These two features operate independently. We have written tests for these features, some of which are still in progress. We have also set up the testing framework to execute these tests. However, end-to-end testing still needs to be conducted.
