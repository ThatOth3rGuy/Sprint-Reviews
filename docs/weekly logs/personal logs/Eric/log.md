### Cycle Review

Since we have the final user testing event next Friday, the plan for this split is to fully finish the application's features by Wednesday. That way we have the split from Wednesday-Friday to finish up testing and integration of all the seperate branches before the testing. With that said, the first step was to go over the list of necessary requirements and turn everything not already completed into issues (in total there were 17). After that we're just going to assign ourselves issues as we go and try to finish them all by Wednesday.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Fixing peer review dashboard issues
  * 2: Instructor manual student enrollment/unenrollment
  * 3: Password hashing
  * 4: Instructor/Admin course editing
  * 5: Student peer evaluation form
  * 6: Group assignment submissions 
  * 7: Assignment view filtering
  * 8: Instructor feedback on assignments

### Cycle Review

After the Test-O-Rama we have a list of fixes/suggestions to help the UI. First priority is to finish that list. After that, our last major feature that needs implementation is the groups and peer review assignments, I'll be working mostly on creating the groups from the instructor side. As well as this, updating the tests seems to be a never-ending cycle that I will continue to chip away at.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: UI fixes after TestORama
  * 2: Instructor group creation
  * 3: Helping finish peer-review randomizaion
  * 4: Fixing and writing new tests Jest&Playwright

### Cycle Review

For the wedesday to friday split the main goal is to finish fixing the peer review release/randomizer and the group creation features. My main task during this time is to finish the group creation by adding the ability to edit/remove groups and testing it. As well as this I will continue to write/fix the playwright and jest tests from before.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Finish group creation
  * 2: Fix all the testing

### Timesheet

### Cycle Review

For the first half of this cycle I was still in Calgary, so I made sure to do as much as possible on Monday and Tuesday but it was still less than I would normally have done during this split. With that said, I still managed to get in a little over 11 hours working on finishing catching up the testing for the application, and refactoring the course creation/student enrollment to properly handle enrolling students that haven't created accounts yet. While I was doing this the rest of the team has been working on finishing the front-end for everything, and refactoring the majority of the backend functions.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Writing jest tests
  * 2: Updating jest tests to work with database refactor
  * 3: Refactoring student enrollment

### Timesheet
![Clockify Timesheet](./images/EricClockify%2010.2.png)

### Cycle Review
    
This cycle is the final prep before the Test-O-Rama event on Friday. For this cycle the main goal is to complete the anonymous peer review assignment submissions for random students. My tasks to complete this are to write the API handlers that connect the front-end code to the back-end, and to write the actual randomization algorithm. As well as this everyone will be working together to merge everything into 1 branch for the demo. Finally, I am still working on writing all the tests for the application so far.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Create API handlers for peer-review randomization
  * 2: Write the randomization algorithms
  * 3: Merge all current features into demo branch
  * 4: Write jest/playwright tests

### Cycle Review

During the presentation of the MVP we had some issues with our features not connecting together properly. So this cycle we're planning on finializing all of those features so they connect together. My main focus during this time was getting the testing working and writing automated tests for everything we've done so far.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Set up testing database
  * 2: Set up Jest framework
  * 3: Fix all current playwright tests
  * 4: Write Jest tests

### Timesheet

### Cycle Review

As of the end of Friday we will have the major features necessary for the MVP completed independently. The plan for this week is to merge them all together so they're demoable, then write some tests (even if they only run on Brenden's PC). That should be done by Wednesday, then afterwards we can start working on some extra features / fix some front end work.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Admin dashboard page
  * 2: Merge all MVP features to development branch
  * 3: Write Playwright tests

### Cycle Review
    
All the features for the MVP demo on Friday are complete. Now that the playwright tests are finally running (locally, not through docker) we need to write a bunch of tests so we have some kind of test report for the demo. Once that's done we just need to move all the features into a demo branch and update the front-end to make sure everything is presentable

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Write playwright tests
  * 2: Update front-end before demo

### Cycle Review

We have the majority of the features we need to complete for the MVP made into issues, this split is simply working on finishing as much as we can. During this cycle meeting we also discussed and made a workaround to some database issues we're having, for the time being we can't use the init.sql schema to make any adjustments to the database.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Instructor course creation
  * 2: Student course registration
  * 3: Course enrollment via student list (helping Brendan)

### Cycle Review
    
During the meeting today we spent some time working on the testing framework. Automated testing finally works for Brendan but the rest of us are still having issues getting the tests to run. After that we figured out what the next few features we need to work on are, as the course/assignment features we've been working on are mostly finished.

### Cycle Review
    
This was the last week of planning, after this our focus is going to be coding and implementing features. The last thing to do for planning is create and submit the deisgn presentation video. After that we've split our first focus of features throughout the group. Starting with the database & testing setup (Me and Tithi), and the Reverse Proxy & CI setup (Brendan, Yatharth, and Divya)

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Set up the database 
  * 2: Implement Jest framework
  * 3: Create Jest testing for the database setup

### Cycle Review

At this point, design is finished and we're focused on finishing 3 features by Friday. Most of the setup is complete, but the testing still isn't working. We're letting Brendan and Yatharth focus on getting the testing working while the rest of us work on implementing some features. It was decided that the 3 features we'll have done by Friday are the Reverse Proxy for changing between Instructor/Student view, the Create Account/Login with authentication, and the main dashboard view once a user is logged in.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Create landing page
  * 2: Create log in pages

### Cycle Review
    
Several tasks were assigned to each of the team during Friday's meeting. By the time of the meeting, each of us accomplished a significant amount of work either completing or nearly completing what was assigned. Though review on all of the work is required, it seems we managed to reach all of our goals for the weekend cycle. Managing the project boards and working on the system architecture design, tasks are being completed on time and everyone is contributing effectively. With the database design done and ready for review and the framework setup underway, the goal for this next cycle is to finish the framework setup and add all use cases to the kanban board.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Create ER Diagram and explanation
  * 2: Implement Nextjs framework
  * 3: Review other team's project proposals
  * 4: Add all Use Cases to kanban board

### Cycle Review
    
From Monday to Wednesday's Meeting, not much to complete for tasks. After completing Database Design (ER Diagram) and explanation of the design, it will need to be reviewed and then make necessary changes. If changes are needed, that will be high priority to complete for document submission Wednesday night. With all design document tasks nearly complete by everyone assigned to them, all we have left is mainly the UI design. This will likely be finalized during our meeting by Tithi. Evaluations of other team's proposals will need to be completed. With the Nextjs framework set up and running on my laptop, I need to help the rest of the team make sure it works for them, and then work with Brendan to implement it properly with Docker. Once all that is done, we just need to set up testing before we can start committing to coding features.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Implement Nextjs framework
  * 2: Add all use cases to kanban board
  * 3: Help the rest of the team have their Nextjs frameworks running
  * 4: Evaluate other project proposals

## Friday - June 7, 2024

### Cycle Review

On Wednesday's meeting we spent a large amount of time reviewing the UI design on Figma making sure we are all on the same page about everything. After that the main goals until Friday are to get the Nextjs framework, docker, and drone CI all set up. As well as that we need the design video finished by the end of Friday. My main tasks are to finish the framework setup and make sure it works for everyone, and then work with Brendan to get the framework running with Docker. I'll also be making the database Schema in this time.

### Current Tasks
  * 1: Help the rest of the team implement their Nextjs frameworks
  * 2: Create the database schema
  * 3: Implement the Nextjs framework together with docker
