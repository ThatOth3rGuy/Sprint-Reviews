## Monday - June 3, 2024

### Cycle Review
    Several tasks were assigned to each of the team during Friday's meeting. By the time of the meeting, each of us accomplished a significant amount of work either completing or nearly completing what was assigned. Though review on all of the work is required, it seems we managed to reach all of our goals for the weekend cycle. Managing the project boards and working on the system architecture design, tasks are being completed on time and everyone is contributing effectively. With the architecture design done and ready for review, the goal for this next cycle is to start on setting up docker and configure our tests, as well as modify the design after Wednesday's feedback. Project oversight is still an ongoing task, currently without issue.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Software Architecture Design and Explanation
  * #3: Evaluate other project proposals
  * #4: Setup and Run Docker Containers

## Wednesday - June 5, 2024
**Timesheet Tracking is presented in our weekly log**
### Cycle Review
    From Monday to Wednesday's Meeting, not much to complete for tasks. After completing Architecture Design and explanation of the design, it will need to be reviewed and then make necessary changes. If changes are needed, that will be high priority to complete for document submission Wednesday night. With all design document tasks nearly complete by everyone assigned to them, all we have left is mainly the UI design. This will likely be finalized during our meeting by Tithi. Evaluations will need to be completed, with only 1 remaining to complete after watching the other 2 videos for project #3. This is a task that I will need to complete after our meeting. My other goal for this cycle is to get the docker running, which will be after getting the framework running with Eric. This will be one of my main tasks to have for Friday. As always, if any new tasks come up in meeting I will distribute them and update the boards accordingly.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Get feedback on Software Architecture Design and Explanation
  * #3: Evaluate other project proposals (1 remaining)
  * #4: Setup and Run Docker Containers

## Friday - June 7, 2024

### Cycle Review
    Wednesday to Friday there was not a ton of progress done on my behalf, most of my time was spent tracking project workflow via Plaky and the Project Board. Thursday I was only able to spend the afternoon on the project due to work, however as reflected by clockify hours the entire evening was spent trying to get docker running with our framework. I was unfortunately not successful and my primary goal for the next cycle is to make sure that is up so the team can begin coding ASAP. All work for our project design has been done, and the video is in progress. With the next 4 days free to work on the project my goal is to start coding features so there is stuff to review on Monday.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Setup Docker
  * #2: Manage Project Workflow Boards
  * #3: Review Video before submission
  * #4: Help review and track pull requests

### Cycle Review
    Several tasks were assigned to each of the team during Friday's meeting. As we have completed the design, we used our Friday meeting to break down our tasks for the weekend, and decide which features we will need ready for June 14th. We decided on our features and I helped layout our plan for the week, assigning everyone including myself tasks. Over the weekend I spent a lot of hours configuring the docker file to ensure we have working containers for development. Once the containers were **mostly** running properly, the test framework needed to be added so we can start creating  tests for the features. With some success I was able to get testing up. For the weekend cycle I did manage to nearly accomplish everything I needed to while the others were putting together the DB and our CI. My goal for this week is to fix the test framework, and our docker to hopefully build and run containers smoothly while running the E2E tests error free for everyone. I will also help with the DB and testing so that we can have our features ready and tests passing by Wednesday-Friday. We will decide exactly how this will be split during our meeting

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Finalize Docker Setup From Friday
  * #3: Create Automated Test Framework for Project
  * #4: Reverse Proxy Setup and Test
  * #5: Test Database
  * #6: Add Basic Landing Page for App

### Cycle Review
    From Monday to Wednesday's Meeting, I unfortunately was not able to do a ton. Before our Monday meeting, I was able to get the login page up and passing tests, however it is not perfect and will need to be fixed and integrated with our CI. After our meeting my internet went out all day, and had to work Tuesday. I was not able to accomplish all I was tasked with, though the team seems to have picked up my slack. I do believe we are mostly on pace for having all the features by Friday. My goal for the remainder of the week is to make sure the tests work especially the DB, and we will be able to efficiently run our completed features for Friday. I am working on the testing/integrations, and managing the project boards. Wednesday we will breakdown what is left and ensure we are on pace for the project, if any issues are present we will hopefully be able to fix them with little issue.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Setup Docker Compose for DB, Drone, App, and Tests for integrated Testing
  * #3: Fix Bugs in Test Frameworks (Unit and E2E Testing)
  * #4: Reverse Proxy Setup and Test (Simple Redirects vs Proxy API)
  * #5: Test Database (Get tests to properly pass)
  * #6: Add DB to app for Login Function

### Cycle Review
    From Wednesday to Friday's Meeting, there was a ton of things to complete for our presentation. We managed to get nearly all of it complete, and I put in significant amount of hours (mostly losing sleep) between Wednesdays meeting and Friday. I spent nearly all my time working on ensuring the dev containers run  and everything is testable. After many many hours some tests finally passed post integration. I believe we are on a good pace, though with much still to do we all know whats expected. I will continue to manage the workflow boards and task breakdowns, but the goal for the next cycle is to hit the ground running with features. We should get tests and everything set. I hope our demo goes well.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Setup Docker Compose for DB, Drone, App, and Tests for integrated Testing
