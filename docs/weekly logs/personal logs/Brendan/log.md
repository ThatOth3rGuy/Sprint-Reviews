### Cycle Review

As we are finally done the development of the project, the last week has been primarily getting the demos ready for User test on this past Friday, the client demo tomorrow and our final demo for Scott on Friday. We finally and proudly have a fully working prototype, that has almost every feature we intended to have! So much work but finally got here. As I have so much going on this past week, I was not able to put too many hours in and submitted my timesheet for the past week (I did not submit Friday as I only had roughly 4 hours accounted for that cycle). Between demo preperation, we have spent the time ensuring our code is well documented, stable for deployment, and completed all fixes/issues required from the testing. Our bin is nearly empty and very little code left to write, all thats left is documentation and the report. The plan for the rest of the week is to focus on the report, and come Friday I SHALL BE READY TO GRADUATE!!!

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Run and Configure Tests For Database/API Changes & Integration 
  * #3: Review Feedback and Issues From Test-orama - Create Board Issues & Fix Issues
  * #4: Refactor Database Schema to Handle Appropriate Input & Update API/UI Code to handle new DB Tables/Queries
  * #5: Test DB Update Calls Implemented, Fix as Needed
  * #6: Create Final Demos and Final Report

### Cycle Review

As it is now the final leg of the project, we started this cycle planning out how the rest of the term will go. Our hope is to finish 90-95% of the project by the weekend so that
all features and pages will be implemented for the final demo. If this is the case we will just need to worry about preparing the demo server, testing and fixing bugs, in other words
all the pages will have something that does something when interacted with. The hope is that if we are able to have most of the project done before next week, where we only
have the testing, fixes, and deployment to worry about, then there is much less worry about producing a viable product. SO we decided to grind things out this week in order to make 
the last couple weeks less chaotic, stressful, and time-consuming. As we now have the final report to worry about, we cant afford to finally having a deployed app in the final week,
not to mention there are other personal things going on and less stress next week will be good. Overall, this cycle the update is quite extensive as I spent many hours working on
having the assignment randomizer actually function and display. I am happy to say it is mostly working (after staying up all night) With that now being some level of functional,
as well as dealing with the fixes from Friday's Demo, all we need to do is finish the final pages and the connected components AND SLAM EM ALL TOGETHER

This weekend has been a lot, and I should be able to put quite a few hours in over the next couple days, however I will need to slow down on the weekend to move into my place. 
I think we're all doing good, we all put in a lot of time and effort to get where we are and can see the finish line of it all. I am unsure how buggy the app will be when deployed
but as of now I am happy with our progress as a team.

### Current Tasks

### Cycle Review

This past cycle was key for the final stretch of our projects' development. Though we did not complete the near remainder of our features, we have now fully completed all the fixes that were
required. Much time was spent completing a ton of UI and Database Changes, where it's only half of the same project as it was before the MVP. While Tithi and Yatharth spent the week working 
on the UI, and Eric on testing as well as helping me with some backend fixes, I spent all the time I could refactoring our DB schema in order to fix alot of the issues we have been running into.
The DB changes allow for more streamlined queries and table references, and will really help with the randomization algorithm we are currently working on. Along with the fixes, many changes
to our existing UI and API function files needed changes to properly handle the new schema, which I have completed. We now have a properly running database and the UI looks so much nicer.
I could say we are worried a little about having everything we planned done by the deadline with it rapidly approaching, however this week provided major help with the rest of the features.
Thanks to the refactoring, we are likely able to reuse a large amount of code we have already implemented the only thing needed from scratch is the randomization feature.
I think we are slightly behind just because of the amount of time we spent nearly rebuilding our application as well as some personal conflicts reducing the time able to spend on coding.
Overall, we should have the peer review feature and most of all the user views done for the UI Testing on Friday. Once those two are done all thats left is the simple grades and profile pages,
which we should be able to complete by the end of next week, if we stick to our plan and grind out the features the rest of the week.

### Cycle Review

My time spent on the project this cycle was regrettably very minimal. I was really only able to complete some work and complete fixes on Wednesday. We started the morning with a team meeting to discuss our current standing and plan moving forward. This week we want to finish up some updates/fixes to our code/database, then continue on developing the remainder of our features. Unfortunately, I have not yet completed those database changes due to my current situation; packing my house to move into my new place for the end of the month (possibly sooner). I needed to utilize Thursday to pack up things, plus I work from 8-4pm every Thursday. This was a very minimal cycle for me, however for this next cycle I will be completing all the database changes to make our implemented API handlers fully functional as some errors currently exist in how the queries are called. Once that work is done, I will work with the team to implement the next intended features; the randomization algorithm and site-wide assignment view. I believe we are still on track and will complete what is necessary this week and by the project deadline.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Create Feature Definition and Sub-divisions on Project Board For Team Division
  * #3: Run Integration Tests for pushed features (Fix Testing Server Connection)
  * #4: Review Branch Pull Requests and Complete Necessary Fixes
  * #5: Reconfigure App Server & Database Connection for Local or Dockerized Development

### Cycle Review

Between Friday's MVP Demo and Wednesday, the team had quite a bit to take care of. Our Demo didn't go exactly as planned with some errors during runtime, the server not wanting to connect, API calls not working as expected, and general CSS issues. Our plan for the cycle was to focus on the issues present and fix them immediately before continuing on other feature development. Luckily we were able to sort out the glaring issues for our database connection, and inability to properly run tests. Over the weekend I was able to go through and fix our database connection, so we can connect to it when running the app server on our devices localhost instead of docker. With this fix we are now able to make use of the NextJS Dynamic Refresh ability. Prior to this fix, we had to rebuild docker containers to view changes on front-end pages as docker disables the dynamic refresh when we make changes to the code of pages. It made it more difficult to quickly fix CSS issues or API calls when we are constantly rebuilding docker. Another benefit of this fix is the ability to run all our tests easily via localhost connection, bypassing our issue of tests not connecting to dockers server. 

Overall we managed to fix a lot of things this cycle, giving us a much better ability to continue development of features and complete testing without Docker breaking the computers. Now that we have a separate test database, simple server connection, and 2 test frameworks all running, we can continue developing the remaining features and complete the requirements of our project by the deadline as expected. The goal for the next cycle and the next week as a whole, is to make sure all of our API calls are working in all possible cases, possibly refactoring a couple functions for simplicity, and start on the overall assignment view functionality as well as the peer review group randomization. I believe the refactoring will be done before Friday and we will have a start on the features, while by this time next week those features will be nearly if not completely implemented (though may still need some testing). I feel that with the progress made this last cycle and feedback from the MVP, we should be able to finish all requirements before the end of July and spend the remaining time Testing, fixing, and documenting our project for production!

### Cycle Review

As per usual this cycle was very short for myself. With little time between Wednesday's meeting and Thursday evening, most of what was completed/worked on was project management and issue tracking. Wednesday we met as a team and put together the next steps beyond the MVP for what progress has been made. Sorting out work breakdown, testing, how features will interact. Post-meeting I began starting work on refactoring the database as was mentioned in Wednesday's meeting with Scott. Aside from that I spent more GrUeLiNg HoUrS trying to figure out Integration tests via Docker... I don't wanna talk about it anymore. 

Overall as a team we have been working to ensure everything intended and needed is working for the MVP presentation. Between work on the presentation, and testing all feature integration during branch merging, this cycle has actually been quite successful with all of us logging OBSENE hours (as per usual). I think we are ready for the MVP presentation and have a sufficient amount of the project complete for this milestone. Tomorrow we will discuss all our goals moving forward, afterall this is being written super late. Proud of the team #rockstars

### Cycle Review

During this weekend cycle, we had a large amount of work to get done, most of which we managed. We have completed all the features we can for the MVP on Friday, with other partial features still being developed. Though we are still missing one of the vital parts of our app, nearly everything it relies on has been done. With multiple features now complete, most of the cycle was dealing with code inconsistencies and inefficiencies. As all feature components were developed in isolation, our code has a high amount of coupling, thus we have been working to reduce it. 

We have been able to migrate and run most of our expected demo locally, however our docker server (and subsequent testing server) is having constant issues for the team. We plan to correct that during the week, so the MVP demo runs smoothly. Luckily completing about half of our total application, we should be able to fully complete everything by the deadline. Our success at this point is really determined by whether we can get the docker containers to interact as expected. The goal for the remainder of the week, aside from working to keep the timelines on track, is to configure and successfully run all necessary tests for every feature currently implemented. With the backend coding and integration issues mostly solved, we just need to ensure everything can actually be tested and is working correctly. So long as there are no surprises during the MVP on Friday, we should achieve the goal. We all spend a lot of time on the project this weekend, and the team is doing an incredible job regardless of how frustrated we can get.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Refine Docker Environment and Testing Framework For Future Development
  * #3: Create Feature Definition and Sub-divisions on Project Board For Team Division
  * #4: Run Integration Tests for pushed features (Fix Testing Server Connection)
  * #5: Complete Manual Student Entry option for Peer Review Assignment Form Feature
  * #6: Review Branch Pull Requests and Fixes for MVP Demo Branch

### Cycle Review
This mid-week cycle as short as it is, the team managed to get a good amount done. As the cycle is especially short for myself, I spent as much time as possible to work on what is needed. Unfortunately, a portion of that still won't work and as a team cannot find a solution. As such, our E2E testing has been tabled for the time being and over the next week will be testing manually on the server-side. So far, everything is working (or not working) reasonably as expected. Wednesday I spent time laying out of task breakdown for the week ahead to the MVP presentation, and will hopefully keep all of us on track. I do not believe we are off pace, however we will be meeting tomorrow (Friday) to discuss our progress and what we plan to present in a weeks time. Aside from PM duties and testing I have started and continued to work on the sub-feature I was tasked with, which will likely be working complete tomorrow. 

As a team we are making great progress with each feature. I continue to have no doubts in our team ability to meet all requirements by the deadlines. Despite how short this cycle is, we will hopefully have 1-2 more features complete going into the long weekend, with possibly 2 more by the MVP presentation. The goal for the next cycle is to complete the current feature we are working on, ensure integration is successful and complete most to all of the assignment pages for demo on Wednesday. That being said, as a long weekend for Canada Day... I think it's also important we have a little fun, especially with how hard the team has been working! We have put in many hours and will continue to until the deadline and project completion, but we are making great progress.

  * #2: Refine Docker Environment and Testing Framework For Future Development

### Cycle Review
    Over this last cycle, we managed to mostly complete our major features in assignments and class creation. Due to a slower paced week last week and busy schedules, we are slightly behind pace we originally planned. However, having completed two larger features, aside from some changes that need to be made once integrated, we will likely be able to reuse a decent amount of functions implemented. This will help speed up the development through the week and hopefully bring us back on pace. 

    I managed to get the testing framework to run properly, allowing us to test the integration of features moving forward. We will have to start building tests for the features completed and ensure they are running as expected, however there are still existing issues in the testing framework through docker. I seem to be the only one able to run the playwright tests without error, and the rest of the team keeps encountering some. This will need to be investigated and resolved quickly, in the meantime I will likely be the one running such tests. After our early week meeting, we decided what needs to be done this week to make sure we have what is needed for the MVP, and I am continuing to create and assign sub-tasks for the features. Our goal for the remainder of the week is to complete the integration testing and modify the pushed features according to present issues (student list upload db queries and state management added to assignment pages), as well as complete the next assigned feature: The peer review form. With any luck we will be able to complete all this as well as have an admin dashboard up before the weekend. Having all this complete will keep us on pace, and have enough of our application ready to demo for the MVP next Friday. Honestly everyone has put in so much time and effort into this and I have no concerns about us not being ready.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Complete Student List Uploading (csv) and verification for Course Registration Feature
  * #3: Refine Docker Environment and Testing Framework For Future Development
  * #4: Create Feature Definition and Sub-divisions on Project Board For Team Division

### Cycle Review
    During this mid-week cycle, I was not able to spend much time on project work as usual. As I only have one day between Wednesday and Friday to work on the project, only a portion of tasks are able to be completed. Wednesday morning we had our usual team meeting to sort things out and assign tasks. The rest of the day is devoted to project work, of which I spent most of the day dealing with workflow and creating tasks on our project board. With our updated workflow we are more clearly able to track progres on feature development, ensuring there is always ones to pick up when another is complete. It also clearly lays out what must be done, how each feature is progressing, and plan out our feature development goals for each cycle. As I work on Thursdays, I only have the evening to continue on project work, as such I have only been able to make a small amount of progress on my feature task, the student list uploads. Over the weekend I plan to have all my tasks fully completed, test framework functioning (so we can do integration testing on the features), and both features the team worked on this week pushed as fully functional features.

    We have half of both features we started working on at the beginning of the week completed, and will hopefully have the other half complete before Saturday. So far we are still on pace, and have no issues that will put us behind. I will continue managing the project boards each cycle, and my goal this cycle is to have both the testing framework functional, and the student course registration feature complete before Monday so that we can start on the next features. I feel that I am a bit behind the rest of the team this week and will make that up this weekend.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Complete Student List Uploading (csv) and verification for Course Registration Feature

### Cycle Review
    After Friday's presentation, we all decided to take part of the weekend to rest and recharge after a long couple weeks. I was especially burnt out, and spent part of the weekend sleeping. We had a short meeting after the class presentations to sort out workflow and the plan moving forward, which we turned into a long meeting Sunday. The beginning of the cycle was not incredibly productive for the project, but allowed us to spend time reorganizing ourselves and put together a solid branching workflow and feature breakdown moving forward to maximize our weekly output until the project is completed. Sunday, the team met for a few hours to thoroughly breakdown each of our intended features, sub-divide those features into smaller chunks we can work on in parallel. As such, I spent the majority of the cycle putting together the timelines, workflow, task breakdown, and starting to assign those tasks among the team, myself included. Our goal for the cycle (Sunday-Wednesday Morning) was to complete the base system dashboard navigation, being all the corresponding pages it links to, and have atleast one (hopefully two) features completed so a demo could be provided Wednesday's meeting. I believe we will have one feature complete for Wednesday morning, and have another in progress. We are mostly on track with little roadblocks, I do believe we will be able to complete the majority of our features in time for the MVP Presentation. I was not able to get entirely as much completed this cycle as I would have liked, however I did manage to get a large amount of PM work done. My goal for the next cycle and each one moving forward is to maintain the project boards keeping proper track of our team workflow to hopefully avoid any further slowdowns. Aside from that I plan to have all my current tasks done by Friday, ensuring the next feature is started while this one is finished. If we can get 3-4 features doen each week. Lastly, I hope to have all the testing and docker framework working properly in our project by the end of Friday, so we can properly complete integration testing going forward.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Re-organize future project workflow (github project board/issues)
  * #3: Refine Docker Environment and Testing Framework For Future Development
  * #4: Create Feature Definition and Sub-divisions For Team Division
  * #5: Complete Student List Uploading (csv) and verification for Course Registration Feature

### Cycle Review
    From Wednesday to Friday's Meeting, there was a ton of things to complete for our presentation. We managed to get nearly all of it complete, and I put in significant amount of hours (mostly losing sleep) between Wednesdays meeting and Friday. I spent nearly all my time working on ensuring the dev containers run  and everything is testable. After many many hours some tests finally passed post integration. I believe we are on a good pace, though with much still to do we all know whats expected. I will continue to manage the workflow boards and task breakdowns, but the goal for the next cycle is to hit the ground running with features. We should get tests and everything set. I hope our demo goes well.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Setup Docker Compose for DB, Drone, App, and Tests for integrated Testing
  * #3: Fix Bugs in Test Frameworks (Unit and E2E Testing)
  * #4: Reverse Proxy Setup and Test (Simple Redirects vs Proxy API)
  * #5: Test Database (Get tests to properly pass)

### Cycle Review
    From Monday to Wednesday's Meeting, I unfortunately was not able to do a ton. Before our Monday meeting, I was able to get the login page up and passing tests, however it is not perfect and will need to be fixed and integrated with our CI. After our meeting my internet went out all day, and had to work Tuesday. I was not able to accomplish all I was tasked with, though the team seems to have picked up my slack. I do believe we are mostly on pace for having all the features by Friday. My goal for the remainder of the week is to make sure the tests work especially the DB, and we will be able to efficiently run our completed features for Friday. I am working on the testing/integrations, and managing the project boards. Wednesday we will breakdown what is left and ensure we are on pace for the project, if any issues are present we will hopefully be able to fix them with little issue.

## Monday - June 10, 2024
**Timesheet Tracking (Friday-Sunday)**
* ![Clockify Timesheet](./Timesheets/Clockify_Time_Report_Detailed_06_07_2024-06_09_2024.pdf)
### Cycle Review
    Several tasks were assigned to each of the team during Friday's meeting. As we have completed the design, we used our Friday meeting to break down our tasks for the weekend, and decide which features we will need ready for June 14th. We decided on our features and I helped layout our plan for the week, assigning everyone including myself tasks. Over the weekend I spent a lot of hours configuring the docker file to ensure we have working containers for development. Once the containers were **mostly** running properly, the test framework needed to be added so we can start creating  tests for the features. With some success I was able to get testing up. For the weekend cycle I did manage to nearly accomplish everything I needed to while the others were putting together the DB and our CI. My goal for this week is to fix the test framework, and our docker to hopefully build and run containers smoothly while running the E2E tests error free for everyone. I will also help with the DB and testing so that we can have our features ready and tests passing by Wednesday-Friday. We will decide exactly how this will be split during our meeting

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Finalize Docker Setup From Friday
  * #3: Create Automated Test Framework for Project
  * #4: Reverse Proxy Setup and Test
  * #5: Test Database
  * #6: Add Basic Landing Page for App

# Week 4
## Friday - June 7, 2024

### Cycle Review
    Wednesday to Friday there was not a ton of progress done on my behalf, most of my time was spent tracking project workflow via Plaky and the Project Board. Thursday I was only able to spend the afternoon on the project due to work, however as reflected by clockify hours the entire evening was spent trying to get docker running with our framework. I was unfortunately not successful and my primary goal for the next cycle is to make sure that is up so the team can begin coding ASAP. All work for our project design has been done, and the video is in progress. With the next 4 days free to work on the project my goal is to start coding features so there is stuff to review on Monday.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Setup Docker
  * #2: Manage Project Workflow Boards
  * #3: Review Video before submission
  * #4: Help review and track pull requests

## Wednesday - June 5, 2024
**Timesheet Tracking is presented in our weekly log**
### Cycle Review
    From Monday to Wednesday's Meeting, not much to complete for tasks. After completing Architecture Design and explanation of the design, it will need to be reviewed and then make necessary changes. If changes are needed, that will be high priority to complete for document submission Wednesday night. With all design document tasks nearly complete by everyone assigned to them, all we have left is mainly the UI design. This will likely be finalized during our meeting by Tithi. Evaluations will need to be completed, with only 1 remaining to complete after watching the other 2 videos for project #3. This is a task that I will need to complete after our meeting. My other goal for this cycle is to get the docker running, which will be after getting the framework running with Eric. This will be one of my main tasks to have for Friday. As always, if any new tasks come up in meeting I will distribute them and update the boards accordingly.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Get feedback on Software Architecture Design and Explanation
  * #3: Evaluate other project proposals (1 remaining)
  * #4: Setup and Run Docker Containers

### Cycle Review
    Several tasks were assigned to each of the team during Friday's meeting. By the time of the meeting, each of us accomplished a significant amount of work either completing or nearly completing what was assigned. Though review on all of the work is required, it seems we managed to reach all of our goals for the weekend cycle. Managing the project boards and working on the system architecture design, tasks are being completed on time and everyone is contributing effectively. With the architecture design done and ready for review, the goal for this next cycle is to start on setting up docker and configure our tests, as well as modify the design after Wednesday's feedback. Project oversight is still an ongoing task, currently without issue.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Software Architecture Design and Explanation
  * #3: Evaluate other project proposals
  * #4: Setup and Run Docker Containers
