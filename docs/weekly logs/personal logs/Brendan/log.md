# Week 4
## Monday - June 3, 2024
**Timesheet Tracking is presented in our weekly log**
### Cycle Review
    Several tasks were assigned to each of the team during Friday's meeting. By the time of the meeting, each of us accomplished a significant amount of work either completing or nearly completing what was assigned. Though review on all of the work is required, it seems we managed to reach all of our goals for the weekend cycle. Managing the project boards and working on the system architecture design, tasks are being completed on time and everyone is contributing effectively. With the architecture design done and ready for review, the goal for this next cycle is to start on setting up docker and configure our tests, as well as modify the design after Wednesday's feedback. Project oversight is still an ongoing task, currently without issue.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Software Architecture Design and Explanation
  * #3: Evaluate other project proposals
  * #4: Setup and Run Docker Containers

## Wednesday - June 5, 2024
**Timesheet Tracking is presented in our weekly log**
### Cycle Review
    From Monday to Wednesday's Meeting, not much to complete for tasks. After completing Architecture Design and explanation of the design, it will need to be reviewed and then make necessary changes. If changes are needed, that will be high priority to complete for document submission Wednesday night. With all design document tasks nearly complete by everyone assigned to them, all we have left is mainly the UI design. This will likely be finalized during our meeting by Tithi. Evaluations will need to be completed, with only 1 remaining to complete after watching the other 2 videos for project #3. This is a task that I will need to complete after our meeting. My other goal for this cycle is to get the docker running, which will be after getting the framework running with Eric. This will be one of my main tasks to have for Friday. As always, if any new tasks come up in meeting I will distribute them and update the boards accordingly.

### Current Tasks
  * #1: Manage and assign tasks for each cycle (Plaky/Kanban board)
  * #2: Get feedback on Software Architecture Design and Explanation
  * #3: Evaluate other project proposals (1 remaining)
  * #4: Setup and Run Docker Containers
