### Weekly Goal Review :
This week has been exceptionally long because of bugs and Ui fixes, which included many features working in isolation but breaking while working together. Plus a lot of APIs needed a desperate refactor because the changes implemented had two people working on the same page at the same time. I mainly added functionality to modify assignments, and peer reviews,re-randomize and save the new groups of students, modifying user details and fix all bugs in the system which included the student review dashboard, course dashboard for both user types, submission feedback views for both user types etc. I also created the demo video for the client to view the functioning app. Overall a good way to wrap up and have this prototype with minimal issues ready to deploy. Our application is an easy-to-use app which can be implemented in a real live class situation and also outside class. We hope our client likes our product and ends up using it! I would like to thank you for reading my weekly logs, it feels great to know someone was observing our journey as we went through it! I would also give a huge round of applause for my team, they have diligently picked up on issues and solved them. Eric being our testing and backend expert ensures all our tests are in place with also helps others when needed while also developing features as a whole by himself! Brendan was our main DevOps and back-end expert who ensured all our applications were dockerized when other teams were busy deploying Hello World, he also (if anyone did not know) had an active job during the project but he never made any part of the project lack even though we lost a team member in the middle of the course. Lastly, Tithi, our front-end and mindware expert, tirelessly worked on designing the UI and handled all the UI implementation to the bit making the app receive nothing but positive feedback from the user testing, and with that, she also developed individual features you look at the time she has put into the project, is the longest and heaviest part of development. I would also like to thank Dr.Scott and the TA team for helping us at every point when needed and help guide us through our project and holding us responsible if the development was slowing down. With that said, and holding up a tear as I write my final log here, I can say that this course has probably tested and prepared me to do any web application project with no hesitation. With learning to code in Next.js and REACT to create web applications which are to a level industry ready I believe that I walk out of this course with more confidence in my career and I will always remember this project. Thank you to everyone once again this would have never happened without my team and the guidance of my gurus!

### Weekly Goal Review :
Key issues have been addressed, including the refinement of assignment creation forms and the correction of image display on the course creation screen.

Furthermore, development has been undertaken on a peer-review randomizer. This feature, designed to display randomized groups on the peer dashboard view, is currently facing challenges with the algorithm’s input and output not pulling the correct data.

These efforts are indicative of the active role in enhancing the project’s functionality and user experience. Despite the current challenges with the randomizer, the commitment to problem-solving and innovation is evident.   

### Next Cycle Goals:  
* Randomizer algorithm and functionality 
* Adding update features to all pages
* Group Peer reviews and manual group creation

### Weekly Goal Review :
This cycle felt both short and long! We've finally managed to get the entire assignment submission process working, and the instructor's receipt is the only part left, as the randomizer is still under development. I'm hopeful that we'll reach the 90% completion mark by next Wednesday or Friday and have the app ready for testing!   

### Next Cycle Goals:  
* Randomizer algorithm and functionality 
* Adding update features to all pages
* Group Peer reviews and manual group creation

### Weekly Goal Review :
The project has made substantial progress. Both the instructor and student pages have been updated in terms of front-end and UX, improving the overall user interaction. The application is now demo-ready, with a complete flow of all features operational and set for testing. This ensures a seamless user experience. The database has been refactored and optimized, with numerous functions in the db.ts file cleaned and improved to work efficiently with the ‘create assignment’ feature. These updates collectively result in a more efficient, user-friendly application that is ready for demonstration and further testing.


### Next Cycle Goals:  
* Randomizer algorithm and functionality 
* Adding update features to all pages
* Group Peer reviews and manual group creation 
* Fix everything and hopefully have the entire platform with proper functionality ready for user testing

During this cycle, I have mainly inorporated the clients feedback on the fron-end and the logo aspect of the application. The new logo alligns with the new name of the application, Sprint Review. This is an application made by Learnification  and that has been incorporated. The new logo looks like this:
<div>
<img src="images/logo-png.png" alt="alt text" width="50%" height="50%">
</div>

### Next Cycle Goals
 * Fix the remaining front end items and have the basic UI templates fro each pages

### Weekly Goal Review
This week, the focus was primarily on developing the Peer Review Creation form. The objective was to save the base template and the instructor-created rubric to the database. This step enables the commencement of form creation, incorporating the instructor's updated rubric. Additionally, with the assistance of Brenden and Eric, I successfully merged three features into development: the course creation, my assignment creation, and Tithi's assignment creation. Lastly, I have been working on optimizing the software by eliminating duplicate or coupled functions in favor of more generalized functions, again with Brenden's help. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * All my feature tests need to be written and tested 
  * The randomizer and the anonymous system need to be created and worked on
  * A Peer Group evaluation system needs to be made

### Weekly Goal Review
- I mainly got the instructor assignment creation form to work with the database, where the instructor is exclusively creating assignments for a class and is being handled by the backend to add the information safely
- I got the file upload rubric to convert to text with Tithi for the instructor
- With Tithi, we got the students' submission of assignments to work with the instructor to create an assignment
- I also had a final exam on Monday, so I finished the majority  of the components last week


### Next Cycle Goals
 * Peer review form for instructor to be created
 * The form has rubric upload handling to be done, I will be doing that 
 * Tests to be written for Assignment creation and submission for it to be ready to be tested and help get the DroneCi to work with tests

### Weekly Goal Review
- We split the features down into sub features and are making it work in isolations following these steps in our developemnt:
    1. Divide the feature into different components 
    1. Split into even sub components worked by two people 
    1. Then we do PR on the code 
    1. Once approoved we will integrate it in pairs and test it (end-to-end,database etc.) before merging to development
- I have rectified the database associated with Tithi to ensure its compatibility with the system. Initially, it was functioning as an isolated container, unable to interact with the system. Upon investigation, I discovered that the ports were not exposed to the system. By addressing this issue, I was able to activate the dynamic database GUI. For this purpose, I opted for MySQL Workbench. 
-  I got the assignment creation form to input all text and date tye, still working on apllying file restrictions with Tithi as we are working on the Assignment creation and Submission system as mentioned in the DFD
-

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Get all of the above tested and ready to go in the owen to cook or deploy in PM terms. 
  * State management of users on site need to work with authenticator API  
  * For Any goals after Friday's meeting go here.
