### Weekly Goal Review
I completed administrative tasks as planned, but system analysis and diagram are taking longer than expected due to complexity in some areas of our current system design. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Create slides for design video
  * Shoot my portion of design video
  * Initiate coding process
